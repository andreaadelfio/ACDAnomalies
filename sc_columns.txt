LAT_MODE                -> Spacecraft GNC mode, where the 3 nominal modes are 3(inertial point), 4 (Maneuver) and 5 (zenithpoint/survey). Other modes include 1 and 2 (capture and sunpoint - rarely used) and 6 and 7 (reentry modes).
LAT_CONFIG              -> Flag for the configuration of the LAT (1 = nominal science configuration, 0 = not recommended for analysis)
DATA_QUAL               -> Signed integer value indicating the quality of the LAT data, with the following meanings: 
                                0 = Bad data. Do not use.
                                1 = Good data. Use for normal science.
                                2 = GPS 13 microsecond timing anomaly. Can be used in standard analysis. May affect pulsar timing analysis.
                                -1 = Solar Flare. The standard IRFs do not properly describe the data.
                                -2 = Particle event. The standard IRFs do not properly describe the data.
                                -3 = GRB 221009A. The standard IRFs do not properly describe the data. See the caveats about the data for this source.
